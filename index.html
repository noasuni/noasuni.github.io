    <p>After working on a Wordpress blog based on my hobby of videogames for 2 years, 
    I took an opportunity to volunteer and test my abilities for a good cause for drawchange. 
    I helped make edits and maintain the website for drawchange.org, 
    whose mission is to use art as a means to inspire children. </p>
