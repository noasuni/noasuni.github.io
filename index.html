<h1>Nurudeen Asuni</h1>
<p>After working on a Wordpress blog based on my hobby of videogames for 2 years, 
 I took an opportunity to volunteer and test my abilities for a good cause for drawchange. 
 I helped make edits and maintain the website for drawchange.org, 
 whose mission is to use art as a means to inspire children. </p>
