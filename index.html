    <h3>Unsure of anything besides my passion for videogames, I decided to create a blog to express my journey in 2012. I chose Wordpress
   as the platform of choice and began learning the tricks of trade of HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. </h3>
   <h3>From there, I offered my services to volunteer for the organization drawchange.org to help maintain their website and learn how to
   visualize how to complete the tasks assigned by the founder, Jennie Lobato. Through conversations this led to my current adventure
   at VisionKwest Media.</h3>
   <h3>Our goal at VisionKwest Media was to create a service thats allows businesses to handle their day-to-day while we assist with handling
   the bulk of their online demands and wishes. We maintain customer websites with our Prattis service and I've been at the forefront of working on
   the technical side of it.</h3>
   <h3>From getting around the tricky coding with HTML and CSS, to sparingly but still willingly to inject Javascript code to make various elements work
    to our clients needs, to deciphering the code from my themes and plugins to make the correct adjustments, I'm tasked with making sure the work gets
    done and have enjoyed over the years the experience this position has given me. I want to be able to expand and see what else I can provide for the world.</h2>
